** New Features

- =sonar-sweep= program now available; Implements the first day of AoC 2021 on
  the command-line.
- =minimumJumps-java= program now available; Feed it a bunch of numbers, and it
  will jump through them according the challenge's rules.
- Standard First Release Stuff like =guix.scm= (which currently depends on the
  generated tarball from =make dist=), Project Definitions, and a proper start
  to documentation.
** Bugfixes
