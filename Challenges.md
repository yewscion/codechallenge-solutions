## Key

- ❌: I tried this, and found it so frustrating that I decided not to finish it.
- ⭕: I tried this, and consider my code for it complete!
- ❓: I tried this, and discovered something I didn't know and am still learning.
- ❗: I tried this, and learned something new while working on it!
- ☕: I have attempted this in Java (using OpenJDK 17).
- 👾: I have attempted this is Scheme (using GNU Guile).
- ✨: I haven't tried this yet!
- 🔋: I took code I wrote for this and used it elsewhere!
- 🤖: Work In Progress.

## The Challenges

1. [Minimum Jumps][1] - ⭕☕❗
   
   The concept is simple, but there's a lot of complexity
   underneath it: Given an array of integers where the value stored at each
   index indicates how many indexes forward You can move, print the smallest
   number of jumps needed to reach (at least) the end of the array.
   
   One way to make this more difficult would be to make it so the *entire* jump
   needs to be done—that is, if You'd land passed the end of the array with a
   jump, that jump is invalid. Another idea would be a bi-directional jump,
   where You can jump both forwards and backwards. I'd imagine those two
   combined might create more complex chains.
   
2. [Advent of Code 2021][2] - 🤖👾❗

    The "Advent of Code" is, unfortunately, somthing I only found out about in
    2021 (and was unable to participate each day, due to other commitments. I
    really only did the first challenge or two during the event. However, I plan
    to finish it at some point!

3. [Sparse Arrays][3]


## Other Notes

If any of the challenges listed here go offline, I will attempt to add the
prompts to this repository for archival purposes.

As I amass more and more challenges, it will be interesting to see where my
proclivities lie!
