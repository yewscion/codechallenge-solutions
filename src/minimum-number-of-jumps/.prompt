Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps
that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the
minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first
element). If an element is 0, they cannot move through that element. If the end
isnâ€™t reachable, return -1.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 9 -> 9)

Explanation: Jump from 1st element to 2nd element as there is only 1 step, now
there are three options 5, 8 or 9.  If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 can
be reached. So 3 jumps are made.

Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 10

Explanation: In every step a jump is needed so the count of jumps is 10.

The first element is 1, so can only go to 3. The second element is 3, so can
make at most 3 steps eg to 5 or 8 or 9.
